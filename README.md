# Train-ControlNet-in-Diffusers
Although [ControlNet pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/pipeline_stable_diffusion_controlnet.py) has been officially supported in diffusers, there is no tutorial about how to train a ControlNet from scratch in diffusers, especially when we need to use a different kind of input as control hint. Here, we show you how to build your ControlNet.
